# Impact A* for Entities

## Information
This plugin for the [Impact Game Engine](http://impactjs.com/) adds pathfinding to the entities. It also has a basic path following function, a example for path drawing function and a debug panel for showing the path of all entities.

Since version 1.0.0 it also can take entity types into his calculation. But it is only realy working for fixed obsticles.

**Attention:**
* The entities must be aligned with a tile and
* the size must be an multiple if the tilesize.

More information in the [Impact Game Engine Forum](http://impactjs.com/forums/): http://impactjs.com/forums/code/a-path-finder

It would be very nice when you inform me, with an short email, when you are using this plugin in a project.


## Usage
Check the `example/lib/game/main.js`, `example/lib/game/entities/player.js`, `example/lib/game/entities/enemy.js` and `example/lib/game/entities/enemy2.js`!

**getPath(destinationX, destinationY, diagonalMovement, entityTypesArray, ignoreEntityArray)**

Calculates the path and the the result will be saved in `this.path`.

Since version 1.2.0 you also can activate the max movement with `this.maxMovementActive`. The lenght of the path can be modified with `this.maxMovement`. But you should deactivate the `this.directionChangeMalus45degree` and `this.directionChangeMalus90degree` maluses (Set them to zero ...) to prevent strange paths. Check the `example/lib/game/entities/player.js` for more information ...

* **destinationX and destinationY:** The destination ...
* **diagonalMovement:** If true diagonal movement is activated (Default) and when false it isn't.
* **entityTypesArray:** It is an array! It wants the entity type as string! Example: ['EntityPlayer', 'EntityEnemy', ...]
* **ignoreEntityArray:** Also an array! It wants references of the entities you want to exclude from the including into the collision map! Example: [this, enemey[0], ...]

**followPath(speed, alignOnNearestTile)**

Follows the calculated path. The current heading direction will be saved in `this.headingDirection`.

Heading direction values:
```
1 4 6
2 0 7
3 5 8
```

* **speed:** The velocity which will be used to follow the path.
* **alignOnNearestTile:** If activated (true) and the entity stops between tiles, it will automatically align on the nearest tile.

**drawPath(r, g, b, a, lineWidth)**

Draw the calculated path.

* **r, g and b:** The color of the path.
* **a:** Alpha value of the color.
* **lineWidth:** The width of the line ...

### Info
* The **green player** is controled by clicking on the maps. It can't go through the obstacles, except the one in the middle. Check the player.js how it works ...
* The **red enemy** follows the player. Every 2 seconds it calculates the path to the player. It cannot pass every obstacle. Check the enemy.js how it works ...
* The **blue enemy** follows the player. Every 4 seconds his path is updated. It can pass the obstacles and it cannot move diagonal. Check the enemy2.js how it works ...


## Example
To change the level or work with the code, add in the example folder the missing libary files and folders:
```
lib/weltmeister/
lib/impact/

index.htmlw
weltmeister.html
```

## TODO
* A* search algorithm (getPath)
	* Make it faster
	* Add coordinated movement (For the future ...)
	* More?
* path following (followPath)
	* Very much room for improvments ...
	* Make it more natural ...

* A* search algorithm
	* Entity support
* General
	* Readme improved
	* Example highly improved

##### v0.9.4
* path following
	* alignOnNearestTile option was added: If the path was erased before the entity has gotten to his destination and stands between two tiles, this little check will adlign it on the nearest tile

##### v0.9.3
* A* search algorithm
	* If diagonal movement is deactivated, it uses the manhattan distance heuristic
* path following
